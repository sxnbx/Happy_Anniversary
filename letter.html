      <p>Dear Love,</p>
      <p>Happy One-Year Anniversary!! ♡</p>
      <p>Can you believe it’s already been a whole year since we started this little adventure together? Sometimes it feels like I just blinked and suddenly I have all these memories of you; your laugh, your voice, the way you always know how to calm me down, or make me laugh when I least expect it.</p>
      <p>Being with you feels like a warm comforting bed (and you know I LOVE mah bed). Thank you for being the sweetest part of my day, every day. Whether we’re being silly, having deep talks, or just sitting in silence doing our own things, you always make it feel special. I love our routines, our inside jokes, the random things we say that wouldn’t make sense to anyone else but make perfect sense to us. </p>
      <p>You make me feel safe and cared for, and I hope I do the same for you. I’m so proud of how far we’ve come together through every up, down, giggle, late-night “I miss you,”, sleepy “goodnight”, and when you baby me.</p>
      <p>I love you more than words can ever fully say, but I'll keep trying every day!</p>
      <p>Mahal na mahal kita anh à 💕 ~</p>
      <p>Forever yours,<br>Your BunBun ₍ᐢ. .ᐢ₎ ₊˚⊹♡</p>
