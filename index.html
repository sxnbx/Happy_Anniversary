                <h3>üå± First Moments: The Soft Start | Nov 2021</h3>
                <p> It started with scribbles‚Äîlittle doodles, half-jokes, playful notes exchanged like whispers in passing. Harmless things. Two people drifting on separate paths, brushing past each other in the quiet margins of life.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Unplanned Nights, Unforgettable Moments</h3>
                <p> We weren't supposed to matter to each other. </p>
                <p> Just a moment in each other's timeline. </p>
                <p> But then came one night.</p>
                <p> A single conversation that drifted past midnight. Then another. And another. We talked about everything and nothing‚Äîgames, dreams, heartbreaks, childhood quirks. The hours slipped by like seconds, until we were blinking at the morning lights, still talking, still laughing. The chirp of the morning birds became our cue‚Äî realizing just how badly we have messed up our sleep again. Strangers, yet somehow, it already felt like home.
                </p>
                <p> Those nights became our rhythm- late talks, unfiltered thoughts, shared silences that somehow spoke more than words.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Unspoken Distance</h3>
                <p> <em>Slowly, the rhythm faltered.</em> </p>
                <p> Life pulled us in opposite directions. People drifted in and out and I didn't think you would be one of them. Responsibilities grew heavy. Misunderstandings crept in, unspoken and unnoticed. Somewhere along the way, we stopped being "us." </p>
                <p> What used to be a constant presence turned into a quiet absence</p>
                <p> We were just... gone.</p>
                <p> <em> But then-</em></p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>The Message Between Two Stars</h3>
                <p> One message. </p>
                <p> Just one.</p>
                <p> A spark in the dark, a truth too heavy to stay buried. Apologies. Confessions. Words we never thought we'd say.</p>
                <p> That message changed everything.</p>
                <p> We found our way back. Our paths, once distant and diverging, slowly curved toward one another, like two stars pulled into the same orbit. The emptiness was shattered with laughter and now the silence was different- comfortable, not empty. And in the middle of all the noise and stillness, we saw each other clearly. </p>

        <h2> Chapter One </h2>
        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="event">
                <h3>That First Leap</h3>
                <p><em>Where everything began.</em></p>
                <p> It wasn't just butterfilies- it was a full-blown storm. My heart raced, palms sweaty, pacing circles around the room like motion might calm the chaos. My mind was overwhelmed with voices. The thought that everything we had could unravel or become something more was paralyzing. </p>
                <p> We were risking everything.
                </p>
                <p> The friendship. The rhythm. The comfort of late-night laughter and shared silence.</p>
                <p> But we too a dive.</p>
                <p> The fear softened into warmth. The uncertainty melted into laughter. And that storm in my chest quieted... because you were there.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>Ever-Changing Rhythm</h3>
                <p> We never had just one routine.</p>
                <p> We flowed through them like seasons- each one distinct, yet undeniably ours.</p>
                <p> Some nights, it was gaming until our eyes stung. Other nights, it was venting, crying, and laughing all in the same breath. Even when we were hours, states, entire lives apart‚Äîit felt like we were in sync. Like the second I picked up my phone to text, your message was already there. Like we just knew when the other needed comfort‚Äîeven in silence.
                    It didn‚Äôt matter what we were doing. What mattered was that I got to do it with you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>When the Days Got Heavy</h3>
                <p> Not every part of this year was light.

                    We faced what we couldn‚Äôt control‚Äîstress we didn‚Äôt cause, emotions we didn‚Äôt ask for, and nights that felt heavier than they should‚Äôve been. There were times when neither of us had answers. Times when all we could do was sit in the quiet and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù </p>
                <p> And sometimes...</p>
                <p> That was enough.</p>
                <p> I remember the nights we sat in silence, too drained to speak, but never really alone. I remember the fears that visited uninvited and the way we met them gently:</p>
                <p><em> "You're doing your best."</em></p>
                <p><em> "I'm proud of you."</em></p>
                <p><em> "We'll be okay."</em></p>
                <p> And somehow, through it all, we were still here. Still choosing each other.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>The Smallest Things</h3>
                <p> Then there are the soft things,the quiet parts of us. </p>
                <p> The nicknames: bunbun and tato, tucked into messages like little secrets.
                    Re and tarted‚Äînonsense to everyone else, but sacred to us.
                    The way ‚Äúanh √†‚Äù and ‚Äúem √†‚Äù slip out without trying.
                    The giggles, the teasing, the way you say my name like it‚Äôs the only one that matters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="event">
                <p> A year has passed. </p>
                <p> One whole year of being us.</p>
                <p> Of learning how to love, how to be patient, how to hold each other through joy and through quiet. We've grown. We've stumbled. We've laughed ourselves breathless and cried ourselves back to calm.</p>
                <p> But the funny thing is..</p>
                <p> Even after 365 days, even after all the chaos and comfort, it still feels like we're only at the beginnger. And I don't know exactly where this path leads, but if you're walking beside me I know it will be okay.</p>
